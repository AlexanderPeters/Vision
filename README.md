# Vision
## To Do
- Enable OpenCV to control Camera to prevent windows from accidentally not setting the correct exposure (if possible)
- Add ability to load single images for testing filters w/out a camera
- Average multiple frames for denoising
- Rewrite Main class to remove spaghetti code
- Add ability for user to click on one part of the image and receive pixel values in order to quicken filter tuning
- Move image capture and image processing to seperate threads in order to improve system performance

## Installation
https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B42XozG4U9uCVE1pUHJmY0xEUGM

## Hardware
- Microsoft LifeCam HD-3000
- Green Led Ring https://www.superbrightleds.com/moreinfo/led-headlight-accent-lights/led-halo-angel-eye-headlight-accent-lights/49/
- Led Rings should be Green 80mm
- Computer running windows with the software listed above installed 
- Note: (Linux has some support integrated into the code but, has not been fully tested)
- Note: A Kangaroo + running windows 10 may be used for mobile applications

## Purpose 
The purpose of this project was to further FRC Team 3140's understanding of Vision Processing and to increase team readiness
for the 2017 competition season. It was also developed for personal education and later use in projects by myself.
